# ATM-SYSTEM_TimeBasedOTP

Secure Java ATM System with OTP Authentication
This repository contains a prototype of a Java-based Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system, designed to enhance security through the integration of One-Time Password (OTP) authentication. Developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this project addresses the growing vulnerabilities of traditional PIN-based ATM systems to fraud, identity theft, and data breaches.
